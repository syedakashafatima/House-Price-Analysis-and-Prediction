# House-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction
# OVERVIEW
This project aims to develop a house pricing prediction model using machine learning techniques. The key steps involved include data exploration, feature engineering, outlier analysis, model selection, and evaluation. Through visualizations, we gained insights into the distribution and correlations of house prices. Feature engineering transformed raw data into meaningful variables, and outlier analysis ensured the accuracy of our predictions. After evaluating several models, the Random Forest model was selected for its superior performance. Predictions were made for hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate the model's applicability.
